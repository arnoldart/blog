er, that was my fault, I suggested it. Sorry.

Pretty much the whole story is in the commit. The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print "<em>gimme gimme gimme</em>", because of the Abba song called "<em>Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight</em>":

A few people were amused to discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today.

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that one turned up eventually, but it did take six years.
