<b>Pasta With Roast Chicken, Currants and Pine Nuts</b>

<b>Ingredients:</b>
1. 3 ½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, patted dry
2. Salt
3. freshly ground black pepper
4. Paprika
5. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
6. 1 ½ pounds dried pasta, preferably bucatini or linguine
7. 2 teaspoons crumbled dried rosemary
8. ½ cup dried currants or raisins
9. ⅔ cup pine nuts, toasted
10. 3 tablespoons chopped parsley

<b>Directions:</b>
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange thighs in a large roasting pan, preferably nonstick. Thickly sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika, and dot with butter. Bake until just cooked through and skin is crisp (if oven has a convection feature, use it), about 35 minutes.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When chicken is done, let cool slightly, then use hands (rubber gloves are helpful) to pull meat and skin from bones, making bite-size pieces. Reserve meat and skin in roasting pan; discard bones.
3. Meanwhile, add pasta to boiling water and cook just until tender but not mushy. Reserving 1 cup cooking water, drain pasta and add to roasting pan with chicken meat and skin. Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water to roasting pan on stovetop and turn heat to low.
4. Add rosemary, currants and pine nuts to roasting pan and toss, adding more salt and black pepper to taste, and more cooking water if mixture seems dry. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately in shallow bowls.
